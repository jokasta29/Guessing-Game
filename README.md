# Guessing Game

Welcome to my second coding project on GitHub! This is a simple number guessing game developed in Java, designed to help me further explore programming concepts. Although it's a basic project, it demonstrates my ability to create interactive applications and showcases my commitment to continuous learning.

## Project Description

The Guessing Game is a console-based application where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 30. The game provides feedback on each guess, guiding the player to find the correct number.

## Key Features

- Random Number Generation: The game generates a random number between 1 and 30 using the `Random` class from the `java.util` package.
- User Input: The game prompts the player to enter their guess using the `Scanner` class from the `java.util` package.
- Guess Feedback: The game provides feedback on each guess, informing the player if their guess is too high or too low.
- Game Over: The game ends when the player correctly guesses the secret number, and a congratulatory message is displayed.

## Development Details

The Guessing Game is developed in Java, utilizing the `Random` and `Scanner` classes from the `java.util` package. It showcases my understanding of basic input/output operations, conditional statements, loops, and random number generation.

I built this game to challenge myself and strengthen my problem-solving skills. While it may appear simple, it reflects my commitment to mastering fundamental concepts and lays the groundwork for more complex projects in the future.

## Usage

1. The game generates a secret number between 1 and 30.
2. Enter your guess when prompted.
3. The game will provide feedback on each guess, indicating if the guess is too high or too low.
4. Keep guessing until you correctly identify the secret number.
5. The game will display a congratulatory message upon successful guessing.
